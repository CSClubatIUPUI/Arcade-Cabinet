# CS Club Arcade Cabinet

This is the menu system that runs the arcade cabinet created by the CS Club at IUPUI. This menu system has seen many iterations, from python, to js, to c++, and (now) to Godot.

### Why re-write it again in Godot?

While previous iterations have been built using *frameworks*, this time, we will use Godot, an open source full game-engine, editor, and community. The benefits of this are that we can avoid coding everything from input to graphics, and focus on polish and functionality. This iteration will be easier to install, build, and work on cross-platform. It will also look and work a lot better to our end users. After all, non-developers only care about looks!
